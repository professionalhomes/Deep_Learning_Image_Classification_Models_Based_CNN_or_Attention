# Deep-Learning-Models-For-Classification

## Introduction
This project organizes classic convolutional neural networks:

1. AlexNet        Blog Introduction Link: https://blog.csdn.net/qq_39297053/article/details/123839843
2. ZFNet          Blog Introduction Link: WRINTING
3. VggNet
4. GoogleNet
5. ResNet
6. DenseNet
7. MobileNet
8. ShuffleNet
9. SENet
10. Vision_Transformer
11. Swin_Transformer
12. EfficientNet
13. MLP-mixer
... ...

In additon, I write training and inference python scripts for image classification task

## configures
The code of this project is implemented by the python language based on the pytorch deep learning framework
